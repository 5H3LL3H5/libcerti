Installation
------------

See INSTALL for detailed generic installation instructions. This
program uses GNU Autoconf/Automake, so your standard ./configure /
make / make install procedure should work, if you're used to this kind
of installation.

If not, your ./configure command should look like: 

[env {definitions}] ./configure [options] 

for non-standard include/lib path. The installation directory can be
set with the --prefix option (default: /usr/local).

- Example 1: This line launches the configuration, with standard
defaults and "$HOME/CERTI" as the target directory:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/CERTI

- Example 2: Using a recent GCC and a quite old X library, we had to use
a "-fpermissive" option in each compilation command. This can be done
by modifying the CXXFLAGS variable:

env CXXFLAGS="-fpermissive " ./configure --prefix=$HOME/CERTI

- Example 3: This is the line we used on Solaris 6 stations, note how the
default compiler names and directory values can be modified:

env CC=cc CXX=CC CXXFLAGS="-RTTI -g -features=no%conststrings -I/opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/include/CC " LDFLAGS="-L/opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/lib/CC4 -L/opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/lib/CC4/libp -lC " ./configure --prefix=$HOME/CERTI

You'll find an installation document in the doc directory.
