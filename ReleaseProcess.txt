This file tries to describe the current CERTI release process.
Current version is written for a CERTI administrator 
and may certainly be only readable for them.

CERTI releases should be done with the following steps:

1) Announce release freeze on certi-devel
   and check for no-go message

2) Review currently opened and fixed bug/task in the tracker

    Bugs:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=certi
    - checked if fixed are really CVS and switches
       status from ReadyToTest to Done
                   from Open to Closed
                   check the Release 

    Tasks:
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/?group=certi
    - checked Done or ReadyToTest tasks
      close them and fix the Release.

3) Edit tsp/CMakeLists.txt
   and bump the version to the right number with
   [example for certi-3.2.5]

   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR "3")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR "2")
   SET(PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH "5")

4) commit the modified files
   tsp/CMakeLists.txt
   with a meaningfull comment saying you are preparing a CERTI version

5) Do a fresh checkout somewhere
   Build certi from your pristine source tree

     Better is at least 2 built:
         Linux ix86 wth gcc  (32bits)
         Windows win32 with Visual Studio or Wascana

6) Run autotests :))
   Which means for today run as many tests as you can do
      - billard
      - HLA Tutorial

7) Tag certi tree with appropriate version

   cvs tag CERTI-3_2_5 certi

   Generate the Changelog file using certi/scripts/cvs2cl.pl

   For example updating Changelog for CERTI 3.2.4 to 3.2.5 will be done
   using the following command:

   cd /path/to/certi
   scripts/cvs2cl.pl -t -r --delta CERTI-3_2_4:CERTI-3_2_5 --prune -T --accum 

   commit the Changelog file
   force the tag on it:
   cvs tag -F CERTI-3_2_5 certi/Changelog

8) Make certi packages using cpack
     - tar.gz (sources)              [mandatory]
     - RPM (sources and binaries)    [optional]
     - Win32 NSIS binary installer   [recommended]

9) Tests your packages or ask for help to test them
   on certi-devel
   Fix packaging trouble if any and move the previous tag 
   if any commit occured.

10) digitally sign the packages you made and put them
   in the download area:
   https://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/DownloadArea

   gpg -b certi-3.2.5.tar.gz

11) Check is the download area has been properly updated
     http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/

12) post the appropriate news on Savannah CERTI pages
   https://savannah.nongnu.org/news/submit.php?group=certi

   DON'T MAIL to certi-devel since news are 
   automagically forwarded to appropriate ML

   Remember that once you have posted the news you should
   approve it before it appears on first page.


You are right this process IS painful and should be automated (a lot...)
be sure we are working on it :))
