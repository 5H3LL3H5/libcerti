/**
 * @mainpage
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the CERTI documentation.
 * CERTI is an Open Source HLA compliant  
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-Time_Infrastructure_(simulation)">
 * RunTime Infrastructure (RTI)</a>.
 * You'll find hereafter the documentation for the main modules
 * of the CERTI project.
 * CERTI is primarily developed and maintained by the Toulouse research center of ONERA [http://www.onera.fr], the French Aerospace Labs. 
 * The primary goal of CERTI is to be used in research activities but CERTI has a growing
 * number of users and contributors among the CERTI Open Source community.
 * 
 * People interested in CERTI may join the CERTI Open Source
 * community at <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi">
 * https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi </a> and/or
 * by using the mailing list 
 * <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/certi-devel">
 * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/certi-devel </a>
 * for discussion regarding CERTI usage.
 *
 * \section certi_modules Main CERTI Modules
 * The main CERTI modules are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> \ref libCERTI </li>
 *   <li> \ref libRTI </li>
 *   <li> \ref Billard_Application </li> 
 * </ul>
 * There are some RTI-agnostic libraries or applications which
 * are bundled with the CERTI distribution:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> \ref libHLA </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * \section certi_sdk Installing and using CERTI SDK
 * 
 * CERTI SDK comes as either as an installer (binary) or compressed tar source archives.
 * The primary distribution format is gzip compressed tar source archive (.tar.gz)
 * or ZIP archive (.zip) and may be found on Savannah CERTI download area: <a href="http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/"> http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/ </a>.
 *
 * CERTI build system uses  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake,  http://www.cmake.org/ </a>
 * which is a cross-platform build system generator. CMake should be used to 
 * compile CERTI SDK on a variety of platform/compiler combination like:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Linux x86 / gcc </li>
 *   <li> Linux x86_64 / gcc </li>
 *   <li> Solaris Sparc / Sun Studio </li>
 *   <li> Windows / Visual Studio </li>
 *   <li> Windows / Code::Blocks+MinGW </li>
 *   <li> ... </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * You may follow generic CMake usage instruction for building CERTI
 * on various platforms:  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html">Running CMake,  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html://www.cmake.org/ </a>
 * or you may try to follow the below CERTI CMake usage.
 * 
 * \subsection certi_sdk_TARGZ Tarball based SDK
 * 
 * If you get a tarball source CERTI distribution such as you may found in the download 
 * section of the Savannah project 
 * <a>http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/certi/</a>, 
 * you should follow these steps: 
 * <ol>
 * <li>untar the archive: tar zxvf certi-\<version\>-Source.tar.gz 
 *     this should create a certi-\<version\>-Source directory
 * </li>
 * \verbatim
 tar zxvf certi-3.2.4-Source.tar.gz
 ... wait for tar ending ... \endverbatim
 * <li>Prepare separate build directory and run CMake
 * </li>
 * \verbatim
 mkdir build_certi
 cd build_certi
 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /path/to/certi-\<version\>-Source
 ... wait for cmake run  ending ... \endverbatim
 * <li>compile your certi</li>
 * \verbatim
 make
 ... wait the compilation end ... \endverbatim
 <li> Then you may either install CERTI or build
      a binary package that will be usable for installation</li>
 <ul>
 * <li>install CERTI</li>
 * \verbatim
 make install
 ... wait for make install end ... \endverbatim
 * <li>build your binary package </li>
 * \verbatim
 make package \endverbatim
 </ul>
 * </ol>
 * After that you will have a compiled and usable CERTI package.
